        "# - **Your Task**: Use `GradientTape` to compute the derivative of the sum of elements in tensor `A` with respect to each element in `A`.\n",

        "#### Detailed Explanation\n",
        "# 1. **Record Operations**:\n",
        "#    - First, you need to create a context using `tf.GradientTape()`. Inside this context, you will define the operation for which you want to compute the derivative.\n",
        "#    - In this case, the operation is the sum of all elements in tensor `A`.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. **Compute the Derivative**:\n",
        "#    - The derivative you need to compute is how much the sum of all elements in `A` changes when you change each individual element in `A`.\n",
        "#    - In mathematical terms, if `S` is the sum of all elements in `A`, you are computing ∂S/∂A[i][j] for each element A[i][j].\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. **Why Is This Useful?**:\n",
        "#    - Understanding how to compute such derivatives is crucial for gradient-based optimization algorithms, which are the backbone of training neural networks.\n",
