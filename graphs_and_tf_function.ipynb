        "\n",
        "For an interview, it's important to have a clear and concise understanding of TensorFlow graphs and `tf.function`. Here's a summarized explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **TensorFlow Graphs**: In TensorFlow, a graph represents a series of computations. Each computation (like mathematical operations) is a node, and the data (tensors) flowing between them are edges. Graphs enable efficient execution by optimizing calculations, facilitating parallel processing, and allowing operations to be performed independently of the Python runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`tf.function`**: This is a TensorFlow decorator that converts a Python function into a TensorFlow graph. It allows for normal Python code, including control flow statements, to be automatically transformed into TensorFlow's graph operations. This conversion optimizes the function for performance and is crucial for deploying TensorFlow models in non-Python environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **AutoGraph**: Part of `tf.function`, AutoGraph converts Python-specific constructs (like loops and conditional statements) into TensorFlow graph-compatible code. This ensures that Python functions work seamlessly in a graph environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding these concepts is key for TensorFlow models, as they impact performance optimization and model deployment.\n",
